# Largest Number
# Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.
# Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

def largestNumber (nums) :
    nums = [str(num) for num in nums]
    tempNums = []
print(largestNumber([10,2]))
