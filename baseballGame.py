# Baseball Game
# You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.
# You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:
# An integer x.
# Record a new score of x.
# '+'.
# Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
# 'D'.
# Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
# 'C'.
# Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
# Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

# The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.
